## ARound, an ARKit Project

Find your destination in the real-world with use of ARound, an iOS App that takes advantage of ARKit. ARound takes your location and the location of significant areas around you, then generates a marker in front of the location so you can see where it is. It will even give you the name and some information about the place of interest. This project was developed at the SBHacks IV Hackathon between [Duc Dao](https://ducdao.io/), [Matthew Montoya](bit.ly/msmontoya2), and [Daniel Villa](https://github.com/djvilla).

##### This continues to be a work-in-progress && following SBHacks IV, will be available as an open-source project for the community to experiment with. Some of our hopes for furture work include--

* Integration with ProjectDent's [ARKit-Core Location](https://github.com/ProjectDent/ARKit-CoreLocation), an open-source project.
* Intergration with the [Google Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/) for superior navigation performance.
* Implementation of Google Maps' [Location Sharing](https://blog.google/products/maps/share-your-trips-and-real-time-location-google-maps/) feature for finding your friends in crowded spaces (or finding your mom at Whole Foods). 

###### This application is not intended for App Store submission. Rather, we look foward to seeing what individuals from the open-source community dream of next!
###### Created with love in Santa Barbara, California; Now a community-maintained project.
